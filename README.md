### Project Description

**Project Name:** CRUD Application

**Technology Stack:**
- **ASP.NET Core 8.0**: Framework for building web applications on the .NET platform.
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source relational database management system.
- **Docker**: Platform for automating application deployment in containers.

**Description:**

This CRUD application is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of creating and managing data using a modern technology stack. Key features of the application include:

1. **CRUD Operations**:
   - **Create**: Add new records to the database.
   - **Read**: View and retrieve records from the database.
   - **Update**: Modify existing records.
   - **Delete**: Remove records from the database.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Implemented user authentication system allowing only authorized users to perform CRUD operations.
   - Support for user registration and login using standard ASP.NET Core security mechanisms.

3. **Integration with PostgreSQL**:
   - The application uses PostgreSQL as the database for data storage and management.
   - Configuration of database connections and migrations is handled using Entity Framework Core.

4. **Containerization with Docker**:
   - The application and database are packaged in Docker containers, simplifying deployment and management of the runtime environment.
   - The Dockerfile is configured for automated build and deployment of the application and database.

**Project Goals:**
- Demonstrate the use of ASP.NET Core 8.0 for creating a full-featured web application with CRUD functionality and authentication.
- Showcase integration with PostgreSQL and effective use of Docker for containerizing applications.

This project serves as an excellent starting point for exploring modern approaches to web application development and data management.
