### Project Description

**Project Name:** CRUD Application

**Technology Stack:**
- **ASP.NET Core 8.0**: Framework for building web applications on the .NET platform.
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source relational database management system.
- **Docker**: Platform for automating application deployment in containers.

**Description:**

This CRUD application is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of creating and managing data using a modern technology stack. Key features of the application include:

1. **CRUD Operations**:
   - **Create**: Add new records to the database.
   - **Read**: View and retrieve records from the database.
   - **Update**: Modify existing records.
   - **Delete**: Remove records from the database.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Implemented user authentication system allowing only authorized users to perform CRUD operations.
   - Support for user registration and login using standard ASP.NET Core security mechanisms.

3. **Integration with PostgreSQL**:
   - The application uses PostgreSQL as the database for data storage and management.
   - Configuration of database connections and migrations is handled using Entity Framework Core.

4. **Containerization with Docker**:
   - The application and database are packaged in Docker containers, simplifying deployment and management of the runtime environment.
   - The Dockerfile is configured for automated build and deployment of the application and database.

**Project Goals:**
- Demonstrate the use of ASP.NET Core 8.0 for creating a full-featured web application with CRUD functionality and authentication.
- Showcase integration with PostgreSQL and effective use of Docker for containerizing applications.

**Deployment Instructions:**

1. **Install Docker:**
   - **Windows:** Download and install Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and follow the installation instructions.
   - **Linux:** Install Docker by following the instructions for your distribution from the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and clone the project repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

   Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
   - **Windows:**
     Run the following command to build and start the containers:

     ```bash
     docker compose up --build -d
     ```

   - **Linux:**
     Use `sudo` if necessary to run Docker commands:

     ```bash
     sudo docker compose up --build -d
     ```

   This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for your ASP.NET Core application and PostgreSQL database in detached mode.
